* Predefined Mapping Rules Between Source and Target Language Features
- differences exist between a feature in the source language and the immediately apparent equivalent in the target language
- use predefined rules to mitigate that
* Type-Compatibility-Driven Translation
- Type-compatibility ensures that a concrete value of a type in the source language can be converted to a concrete value of the corresponding type in the target language
* Visibility modifiers and import statements
- a dependency analysis to post-process all translations, ensuring the correct visibility modifiers and import statements are applied,
