#+title: improve code gen by improve variable names
#+filetags: :LLM:ideas:

* Background
- Prior research [cite:@wangNaturalBestModelAgnostic2024] has shown that LLM mainly pay attention to the variable names
- but human programmer are sometimes bad at variable names
* Method
- Find all variables in a partial code
- Ask AI to create more descriptive names for each
- refactor
* Misc
- we can first try to make variable names worse to see variable name effects
