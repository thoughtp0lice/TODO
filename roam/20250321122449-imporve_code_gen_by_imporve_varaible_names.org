#+title: improve code gen by improve variable names
#+filetags: :LLM:ideas:

[[id:a23bf13b-4d1d-44a6-8fa0-991370014ec5][Project Idea]]

* Background
- Prior [[id:42b4a0a3-1bb3-453d-9099-d034bd4ac872][research]] [cite:@wangNaturalBestModelAgnostic2024] has shown that [[id:374d0242-6d95-4b4f-adaa-1f7211b39f59][LLM]] mainly pay attention to the variable names
- but human programmer are sometimes bad at variable names
* Method
- Find all variables in a partial code
- Ask AI to create more descriptive names for each
- refactor
* Misc
- we can first try to make variable names worse to see variable name effects
