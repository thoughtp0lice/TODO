#+title: Crypto Koi

This [[id:e73a2a1c-99ac-4723-9639-08bdb0d94bfd][Personal Project]] is about crypto koi. It works like this:

- Create a koi coin that works like normal crypto currencies like mining and etc
- Then user can submit a fixed amount the coin (Or fix percentage of the coin existing) in exchange for a Koi
- Koi is just a set of attributes of the koi but we can also provide an official visualizer for what the koi could look like
- Different features have different level of rareness
- The users can use koi coin to trade kois also
- The koi feature is determined by the hash of the block the koi is submitted, a seed submitted by user
