#+title: C2SaferRust: Transforming C Projects into Safer Rust with NeuroSymbolic Techniques - Nitin, Vikram and Krishna, Rahul and do Valle, Luiz Lemos and Ray, Baishakhi

* Translation Orchestrator
- Break project down into units and order it by dependencies
- Break divide the function by AST subtree
- Aided by static analysis
- Use a call graph to order the functions, units inside functions is not ordered
- root unit: the unit that contains the functions and all units inside
- inner unit: the unit that is inside the function
* Static Analyzer
- call graph, dataflow analysis
** Root unit
1. The source code of the translation unit
2. The functionâ€™s call sites
3. Global variables used in the function
4. Module imports used in the file
** Inner unit
1. The source code of the translation unit
2. Its live-in and live-out variables
3. Global variables used in the translation unit
4. Module imports used in the file
* Dataset
- Coreutils :: split, pwd, cat, truncate, uniq, tail, and head
