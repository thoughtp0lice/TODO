* Method
** Perceptual Image Compression
- use autoencoder to compress image
  - loss
    - perceptual loss
    - patch-based adversarial objective
  - 2d latent space used in DM
  - Regularizations
    - KL-reg: KL-penalty towards a standard normal on the learned latent
    - VQ-reg: uses a vector quantization layer within the decoder.
** Latent Diffusion Models
- pretty much just [cite:@hoDenoisingDiffusionProbabilistic2020]
- the model predicts the noise added to the 2d latent at time t
- the model is a time-conditional UNet [cite:@ronnebergerUNetConvolutionalNetworks2015]
** Conditioning Mechanisms
- encode \(y\) into \( \tau_\theta(y) \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times d_\tau} \)
- Then use cross attention to map the encoding to a cross attention layer
