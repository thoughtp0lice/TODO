- prior methods uses attention information to decide which code tokens should be dropped in code simplification
- author argues that it should only depend on the nature of the code
- findings show that token types is highly impactful
  - there are more symbols (explained in [[id:8abe51f9-5f38-4797-98b4-9c86525585f8][Token Category and Removal]]) than variables & method signatures in the program
  - but removing symbols results in way lower performance drop

- Lexical Level
  - Symbol tokens :: defined as the ones including brackets, separators and operators
  - Identifiers :: variable names, method names, etc
  - Syntatic Level :: use AST to identify
    - Tokens in Control Structures :: keywords for control-flow statements, like ~if~, ~for~
    - Tokens in Method Signatures :: tokens in method declaration and parameters
    - Tokens in Method Invocations :: call to methods which include name, parameter return value
- Semantic Level :: keep only  tokens in Program Dependence Graph (PDG)

- Minimizing the volume of code entered can significantly cut down on training
time.
- Making up a substantial portion of the content yet have minimal impact on
performance, symbols are well-suited for code removal.
- The tokens within method signatures wield the most substantial influence over
downstream tasks, particularly those pertaining to generation tasks.
- Tokens that are not present in PDGs have little impact on downstream tasks due
to their little semantic information
- method signature > identifiers > control structures â‰ˆ method invocations > symbol tokens
