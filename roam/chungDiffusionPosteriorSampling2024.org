#+title: Diffusion Posterior Sampling for General Noisy Inverse Problems
#+filetags: :diffusion:

- Inverse problem: measurement -> data
  - measurement could be anything that reduce the information in data and correspond to multiple data points
  - like blur, masking part of the image, pixelate the image

* Solving inverse problem with diffusion models
- \(\nabla_{x_t} \log p_t(x_t|y) = \nabla_{x_t} \log p_t(x_t) + \nabla_{x_t} \log p_t (y|x_t) \)
- \( \nabla_{x_t} \log p_t(x_t) \) is the score function [[id:6f4c3a14-64a5-4510-b052-96e03c8d2920][diffusion]] models are estimating
- \(\nabla_{x_t} \log p_t (y|x_t)\) is hard to find
  - prior work did a sample then project method so the intermediate image is projected to be consistent with the measurement
  - this work finds a way to estimate it
